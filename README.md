# Fortran-and-C-in-R

This is my page/repo as a learning hub for optimizing R code by
invoking directly C/Fortran functions and subroutines.  I will be
using the following tutorials to build these suite of tutorials and
examples. 

Here I would like to explore: 
- writing C/Fortran code 
- invoking user-written C/Fortran code in R
- invoking external C/Fortran libraries in R
